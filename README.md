## Notes
- First time I've implemented React. Further research is necessary to cross-reference patterns and syntax used to ensure it conforms with React community best practices.
- Used SQLite for simplicity. As the data is stored in a hash / json type object, any NoSQL or SQL database could be configured as the datastore.
- Currently loading jQuery merely to handle AJAX requests, which is a little like bringing a bazooka to a water gun fight. If jQuery continues to only be used for this isolated functionality, it would be preferred to omit jQuery in favor of a slimmer AJAX library (superagent, axios, react-ajax, reqwest, et al).
